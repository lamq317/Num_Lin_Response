# Num_Lin_Response

An implementation of a Feshbach projection scheme to a one-dimensional optical setup for the formulation of quantized photonic bath and system modes, as described in Lentrodt, D. and Evers, J. PRX 10, 011008 (2020).
The latter approach is used to parameterize a few-photonic-modes model that is interfaced with the MCTDH package (Chem.Phys.Lett. 165 (1990), 73) for the computation of the scattering spectra of molecular polaritons (reflection, absorption and tarnsmission).
